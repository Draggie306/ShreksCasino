# HOW TO USE MY SUBROUTINEZ
- To add a value to a card's balance, paste in this: `change_credit_card_balance(10)` (and obviously change `10` to any number to add by. Or `-10` for -10.)

- To get a credit balance, paste in this: 
`call_credit_balance(credit_card)` (`credit_card` is already determined from a user's earlier input). This will change the variable `money` to the money from the file. It will also print `You now have {money}`.

# OTHER STUFF
- Use the **Version Control** tab on the left when you want to save some code you've done. This is useful in case we need to roll back the code quickly and easily
